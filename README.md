# Wordle-ish

### Background

A simple yet addictive browser game created by Josh Wardle, Wordle took the US by storm during the global pandemic. It is an online word puzzle game in which players must guess a hidden five-letter word within six guesses. Wordle-ish is a clone of Wordle with a more obscure and limited list of possible hidden words.

### Gameplay

In Wordle-ish, the player is presented a blank grid above a grid of buttons styled as a keyboard. As players click the keyboard keys, the corresponding letters populate on the grid above. Players must type a valid word and click enter to submit.

After each guess submission, the game provides feedback on their guess by coloring the tiles on the grid. A green tile indicates that the guessed letter is correct and in the correct position. A yellow tile indicates that the guessed letter is in the hidden word, but in the wrong position. A grey letter indicates that the guessed letter is not part of the hidden word.

The aim is for players to deduce what the hidden word is based on logic and deductive reasoning. Each guess should help the player decide on subsequent guesses so that they can eventually solve the puzzle.
